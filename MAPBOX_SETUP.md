# Mapbox Address Autocomplete Setup

## üöÄ Quick Setup

The property creation form now includes address autocomplete powered by Mapbox! Follow these steps to get it working:

### 1. Get a Mapbox Access Token

1. Go to [Mapbox Account Dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
2. Sign up for a free account if you don't have one
3. Create a new access token or use your default public token
4. Make sure it has the **geocoding:read** scope enabled

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Create a `.env.local` file in the `tink-frontend` directory with:

```env
# Mapbox API Key for address autocomplete
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoieW91cl91c2VybmFtZSIsImEiOiJjbGV0c..." # Your actual token here
```

### 3. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User types address in "Address Line 1" field
2. After 300ms delay, Mapbox API is called
3. Up to 5 address suggestions are shown
4. When user selects an address:
   - Address Line 1 is populated
   - City is auto-filled
   - State is auto-filled  
   - ZIP Code is auto-filled

## üîß Troubleshooting

**No suggestions appearing?**
- Check your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
- Verify the token has `geocoding:read` permissions
- Check browser console for any error messages

**Getting charged unexpectedly?**
- Monitor usage at [Mapbox Account Dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/)
- Each keystroke after 300ms pause counts as 1 request
- Consider increasing debounce delay if needed

**Want to disable temporarily?**
- Remove or comment out `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` 
- Component will fall back to regular text input with a warning message
